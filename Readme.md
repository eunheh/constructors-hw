##Constructors and Prototypes

Constructors: Methods used to build objects and methods within objects.
 - `this` is a reference to the instance that was created.
 - `new` operator creates an instance of a user-defined object type

Prototype: Prototypes are utilized to define methods to all instances of a particular object.

Constructors and Prototypes were placed on objects to add and create methods onto the object.
